        A mother tongue is one of the most important categories for those who speak it. Its significance is multifaceted â€” from identity foundations, through communication, education, and upbringing, to psychological, emotional, and patriotic factors. This is especially important for the diaspora living in foreign language environments. Loss of the mother tongue is the main cause of negative assimilation in new surroundings. Anyone wishing to avoid or reduce this assimilation should, alongside mother tongue schools, actively and purposefully work on learning and preserving the mother tongue in the youngest children. The creators of this app have designed a Bosnian language learning model for the youngest using fun, educational, and age-appropriate methods. <strong>ABC Kids</strong> is a model that, by purchasing the app at an affordable price, can strengthen a sense of belonging for the youngest and preserve our roots (identity).
